The TURBOMOLE software suite is optimized for widely available, inexpensive, and resource-efficient hardware such as multi-core workstations and small computer clusters. TURBOMOLE specializes in electronic structure methods with outstanding accuracy–cost ratio, such as density functional theory including local hybrids and the random phase approximation (RPA), GW-Bethe–Salpeter methods, second-order Møller–Plesset theory, and explicitly correlated coupled-cluster methods. TURBOMOLE is based on Gaussian basis sets and has been pivotal for the development of many fast and low-scaling algorithms in the past three decades, such as integral-direct methods, fast multipole methods, the resolution-of-the-identity approximation, imaginary frequency integration, Laplace transform, and pair natural orbital methods. This review focuses on recent additions to TURBOMOLE’s functionality, including excited-state methods, RPA and Green’s function methods, relativistic approaches, high-order molecular properties, solvation effects, and periodic systems. A variety of illustrative applications along with accuracy and timing data are discussed. Moreover, available interfaces to users as well as other software are summarized. TURBOMOLE’s current licensing, distribution, and support model are discussed, and an overview of TURBOMOLE’s development workflow is provided. Challenges such as communication and outreach, software infrastructure, and funding are highlighted.}",

abstract = {We summarize the molgw code that implements density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory in a Gaussian basis set. The code is dedicated to the calculation of the many-body self-energy within the GW approximation and the solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation. These two types of calculations allow the user to evaluate physical quantities that can be compared to spectroscopic experiments. Quasiparticle energies, obtained through the calculation of the GW self-energy, can be compared to photoemission or transport experiments, and neutral excitation energies and oscillator strengths, obtained via solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation, are measurable by optical absorption. The implementation choices outlined here have aimed at the accuracy and robustness of calculated quantities with respect to measurements. Furthermore, the algorithms implemented in molgw allow users to consider molecules or clusters containing up to 100 atoms with rather accurate basis sets, and to choose whether or not to apply the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the parallelization efficacy of the molgw code over several hundreds of processors.

A revised procedure is proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The resulting procedure is very stable, and the calculated multipole moments converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.}

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}
