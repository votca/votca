  abstract = {The distributed multipole analysis procedure, for describing a molecular charge distribution in terms of multipole moments on the individual atoms (or other sites) of the molecule, is not stable with respect to a change of basis set, and indeed, the calculated moments change substantially and unpredictably when the basis set is improved, even though the resulting electrostatic potential changes very little. A revised procedure is proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The resulting procedure is very stable, and the calculated multipole moments converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.}

It is designed with the aim of generality, extendibility, efficiency, and user friendliness. Its main field of application is larger molecules, transition metal complexes, and their spectroscopic properties. ORCA uses standard Gaussian basis functions and is fully parallelized. The article provides an overview of its current possibilities and documents its efficiency. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}
