If we in addition to the permanent set of multipole moments $\{Q_t^a\}$ allow for induced moments $\{\Delta Q_t^a\}$ and penalize their generation with a bilinear form (giving rise to a strictly positive contribution to the energy),
\begin{align}
U_\textrm{int} &=\frac{1}{2} \sum_A \Delta Q_t^a \eta_{tt'}^{aa'} \Delta Q_{t'}^{a'},
\end{align}
it can be shown that the induction contribution to the site energy evaluates to an expression where all interactions between induced moments have cancelled out, and interactions between permanent and induced moments are scaled down by $1/2$~\cite{stone_theory_1997}:
\begin{align}
U_{pu} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_A \sum_{B > A} \left[ \Delta Q_t^a T_{tu}^{ab} Q_u^b + \Delta Q_t^b T_{tu}^{ab} Q_u^a \right].
\label{equ:u_pu}
\end{align}
This term can be viewed as the second-order (induction) correction to the molecular interaction energy. The sets of $\{Q_t^a\}$ are solved for self-consistently via
\begin{align}
\Delta Q_t^a = - \sum_{B \neq A} \alpha_{tt'}^{aa'} T_{t'u}^{a'b} (Q_u^b + \Delta Q_u^b),
\label{equ:self_consistent_dQ}
\end{align}
where the polarizability tensors $\alpha_{tt'}^{aa'}$ are given by the inverse of $\eta_{tt'}^{aa'}$.


With eqs.~\ref{equ:self_consistent_dQ} and~\ref{equ:u_pu} we have at hand expressions that allow us to compute the induction energy contribution to site energies in an iterative manner based on a set of molecular distributed multipoles $\{Q_t^a\}$ and polarizabilities $\{\alpha_{tt'}^{aa'}\}$. We have drafted in the previous section how to obtain the former from a wavefunction decomposition or fitting scheme (GDMA, CHELPG). The $\{\alpha_{tt'}^{aa'}\}$ can be derived formally (or rather: read off) from a perturbative expansion of the molecular interaction. In this work we make use of the Thole model~\cite{thole_molecular_1981, van_duijnen_molecular_1998} as a semi-empirical approach to obtain the sought-after point polarizabilities in the local dipole approximation, that is, $[\alpha_{tt'}^{aa'}] = \alpha_{tt'}^{aa'} \delta_{t \beta} \delta_{t'\beta} \delta_{aa'}$, where $\beta \epsilon \{x,y,z\}$ references the dipole-moment component.

The Thole model is based on a modified dipole-dipole interaction, which can be reformulated in terms of the interaction of smeared charge densities. This has been shown to be necessary due to the divergent head-to-tail dipole-dipole interaction that otherwise results at small interseparations on the \AA~scale~\cite{applequist_atom_1972, thole_molecular_1981, van_duijnen_molecular_1998}. Smearing out the charge distribution mimics the nature of the QM wavefunction, which effectively guards against this unphysical polarization catastrophe. Since the point dipoles however only react individually to the external field, any correlation effects as were still accounted for in the $\{\alpha_{tt'}^{aa'}\}$ are lost, except perhaps those correlations that are due to the mere classical field interaction.

The smearing of the nuclei-centered multipole moments is obtained via a fractional charge density $\rho_f(\vec{u})$ which should be normalized to unity and fall off rapidly as of a certain radius $\vec{u} = \vec{u}(\vec{R})$. The latter is related to the physical distance vector $\vec{R}$ connecting two interacting sites via a linear scaling factor that takes into account the magnitude of the isotropic site polarizabilities $\alpha^a$. This isotropic fractional charge density gives rise to a modified potential
\begin{align}
 \phi(u) = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int \limits_{0}^{u} \! 4\pi u' \rho(u') d\!u' 
 \label{equ:mod_potential}
\end{align}
We can relate the multipole interaction tensor $T_{ij \dots}$ (this time in Cartesian coordinates) to the fractional charge density in two steps: First, we rewrite the tensor in terms of the scaled distance vector $\vec{u}$,
\begin{align}
 T_{ij \dots }(\vec{R}) = f(\alpha^a \alpha^b) \ t_{ij \dots}(\vec{u}(\vec{R},\alpha^a \alpha^b)),
\end{align}
where the specific form of $f(\alpha^a \alpha^b)$ results from the choice of $u(\vec{R},\alpha^a \alpha^b)$. Second, we demand that the smeared interaction tensor $t_{ij \dots}$ is given as usual by the appropriate derivative of the potential in eq.~\ref{equ:mod_potential},
\begin{align}
 t_{ij \dots}(\vec{u}) = - \partial_{u_i} \partial_{u_j} \dots \phi(\vec{u}).
\end{align}
It turns out that for a suitable choice of $\rho_f(\vec{u})$, the modified interaction tensors can be rewritten in such a way that powers $n$ of the distance $R = |\vec{R}|$ are damped with a damping function $\lambda_n(\vec{u}(\vec{R}))$~\cite{ren_polarizable_2003}.

There is a large number of fractional charge densities $\rho_f(\vec{u})$ that have been tested for the purpose of giving best results for the molecular polarizability as well as interaction energies. Note how a great advantage of the Thole model is the exceptional transferability of the atomic polarizabilities to compounds not used for the fitting procedure~\cite{van_duijnen_molecular_1998}. In fact, for most organic molecules, a fixed set of atomic polarizabilities ($\alpha_C = 1.334$, $\alpha_H = 0.496$, $\alpha_N = 1.073$, $\alpha_O = 0.873$, $\alpha_S = 2.926$ \AA$^3$) based on atomic elements yields satisfactory results.

VOTCA implements the Thole model with an exponentially-decaying fractional charge density
\begin{align}
 \rho(u) = \frac{3a}{4\pi} \exp(-au^3),
\end{align}
where $\vec{u}(\vec{R},\alpha^a \alpha^b) = \vec{R} / (\alpha^a \alpha^b)^{1/6}$ and the smearing exponent $a=0.39$ (which can however be changed from the program options), as used in the AMOEBA force field~\cite{ren_polarizable_2003}.

The electrostatic and induction contribution to the site energy is evaluated by the \calc{emultipole} \calculator. Atomistic partial charges for charged and neutral molecules are taken from .mps-files (GDMA format extended for polarizabilities) specified in the \xmlcsg files. Note that, in order to speed up calculations for both methods, a cutoff radius (for the molecular centers of mass) can be given in \xmloptions. Threaded execution is advised.
