= NAME =

votca-csg - The VOTCA coarse-graining engine

= DESCRIPTION =

Versatile Object-oriented Toolkit for Coarse-graining Applications (VOTCA) is a package intended to reduce the amount of routine work when doing systematic coarse-graining of various systems.
The core is written in C++. Iterative methods are implemented using bash + perl.

Please visit the program site at __http://www.votca.org__.

= SYNOPSIS =

The following commands make up the votca-csg suite.  Please refer to their individual man pages for further details.

: **csg_boltzmann**
Performs tasks that are needed for simple Boltzmann inversion in an interactive environment.
: **csg_call**
Calls script from the interactive framework for the user.
: **csg_density**
Calculates all kind of density profiles.
: **csg_dlptopol**
Create skeleton for dlpoly topology based on atomistic topology and a mapping file.
: **csg_dump**
Prints atoms that are read from a topology file to help debug atom naming.
: **csg_fmatch**
Performs force matching (also called //multiscale coarse-graining//).
: **csg_gmxtopol**
Create skeleton for gromacs topology based on atomistic topology and a mapping file.
: **csg_imc_solver**
Is internally called by inversion scripts to solve matrix equation for inverse Monte Carlo (imc).
: **csg_inverse**
Starts the script to run iterative Boltzmann inverse (ibi) or inverse Monte Carlo (imc), etc.
: **csg_map**
Map a reference trajectory to a coarse-grained trajectory.
: **csg_property**
Helper program called by inverse scripts to parse xml file.
: **csg_resample**
Changes grid + interval and interpolated any sort of table files.
: **csg_reupdate**
Reform the relative entropy update in inverse scripts.
: **csg_stat**
Calculates  all kind of distribuions  (bonded + non-bonded).
