Welcome to VOTCA's documentation!
=================================

VOTCA is a software package which focuses on the analysis of molecular dynamics data, the development of systematic coarse-graining techniques as well as methods used for simulating microscopic charge (and exciton) transport in disordered semiconductors. Its C++ core is interfaced to bash and perl flow-control scripts.
