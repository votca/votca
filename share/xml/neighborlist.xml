                         <description>Each **segments** section contains the type of the two segments. If you have two types A and B this field can be A A, A B or B B.</description>

               		 <description>Each **segments** section contains a cutoff radius for the type of the two segments. A pair of segments is added to the neighborlist if the distance between centers of mass of any of their rigid fragments is below this cutoff</description>
