For more detailed information about the changes see the
history of the [repository http://code.google.com/p/votca-ctp/source/list?repo=ctp&r=default]

== Version in hg ==


== Version 1.3 ==
* new executables: ctp_tools, ctp_dump, ctp_parallel, ctp_testsuite, ctp_update
* ctp_tools wraps light-weight tools that assist e.g. in generating the system mapping file
* ctp_dump extracts information from the state file to human-readable format
* ctp_parallel wraps heavy-duty job-based calculators, allowing for synchronization across processes
* ctp_testsuite provides an easy-to-use environment to run selected tests as well as individual calculators
* ctp_update updates an existent state file to the current version
* new calculators: edft, idft, pdb2map, xqmultipole, ...
* edft / idft (provide interfaces to the GAUSSIAN, TURBOMOLE & NWCHEM packages to compute couplings, internal energies and partial charges)
* pdb2map (generates a system mapping file from an input coordinate file)
* xqmultipole (computes classical configuration energies of charged clusters embedded in a molecular environment)
* enhanced usability via the command-line help, tutorial & test-suite
* a GUI tutorial assists with the first practical steps in using VOTCA-CTP
* an extended and homogenized help system provides short infos on individual calculator options from the command line

== Version 1.0 ==
* parallel evaluation of site energies (Thole model + GDMA) - Tinker no longer required
* much clearer input files (and many more checks for input errors)
* most of calculators are parallel and can be used on a cluster 
* bug in zindo/ctp interface fixed
* state file now contains the atomistic trajectory, rigid fragments and conjugates segments
* support for several MD frames
