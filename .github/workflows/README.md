Actions:

-  `continuous-integration-workflow.yml`: runs `cmake`, `make`, `ctest` and `make install` etc. for many different compiler,
   distro / gromacs combinations and special builds for minimal, internal gromacs and coverage.
    -  common setup parts done by votca/actions/setup action that can be found here: https://github.com/votca/votca/actions. 
       it mainly generates the right cmake arguments (`cmake_args`) for the combination of build parameters.
    - deploy of website and doxygen is happening in `deploy.sh`
- `docker-build.yml`: does the build and deploy of the docker container from the `Dockerfile`
- `continuous-integration-workflow.yml` and `docker-build.yml` are triggered for pushes to master and pull requests to
  master as well as on a schedule once a week to pull in updates from the votca/buildenv container.
