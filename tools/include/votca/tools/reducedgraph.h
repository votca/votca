/**
 * \brief Contains a graph that consits of vertices with degree of 1 or greater
 *than 3
 *
 * The point of this class is to reduce the computational complexity of a
 * regular graph. This is achieved by removing any vertices with degree 2. For
 * example a graph:
 *
 * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 9
 *     |   |   |
 *     6 - 7   8
 *
 * Would be reduced to
 *
 * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 9
 *     | _ |   |
 *             8
 *
 * Notice that the vertices 5, 6 and 7 have been removed, there also exist two
 * edges connecting 2 to 3. The reduced graph still contains all the information
 * associated with the full graph but when used with graph algorithms only the
 * vertices and nodes associated with the reduced graph are used.

   * 1 - 2 - 4 - 9 - 5
